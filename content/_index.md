## Schedule

- 09: 00 - 09: 05 - Welcome session
- 09: 05 - 10: 00 - Keynote talk by [Tuomo Hiippala](https://www.mv.helsinki.fi/home/thiippal/) with the title ["A Semiotic Perspective to Computational Modelling of Multimodal Discourse"](https://github.com/muws-workshop/muws-workshop.github.io/blob/main/content/keynote.pdf).

Tuomo Hiippala is Associate Professor in English Language and Digital Humanities in the Department of Languages at the University of Helsinki, Finland (2018-). He holds a PhD in English Philology from the University of Helsinki (2014) and a Title of Docent in Multimodality Research and Digital Methods from the University of Turku (2022). His current research interests include the multimodality of diagrams and information graphics, and the development of computational methods for building and analysing multimodal corpora. He currently directs two research projects that explore the use of crowdsourcing as a method for creating multimodal corpora and the role of crowdsourcing as a form of academic infrastructure.

Dorothy Zhao is an AI Engineer at Sony AI on the AI Ethics team. Her research focuses on uncovering, evaluating, and mitigating social biases in AI systems, primarily considering the computer vision and image-text domains. She also is interested in improving dataset creation practices, which spans from collecting novel datasets to understanding challenges that practitioners face in this field. Before starting at Sony, she received her BA and MS from Princeton University in computer science.
