**Abstract**: In discussions of mis- and disinformation, facts are often pitted against narratives. However, even reliable and relevant information relies on narration. For instance, journalism does not simply report the facts; it constructs multimodal, transmedial, and serial narratives to explain and engage audiences regarding recent events. How does the increased focus on emotionally charged storytelling impact on the the facts and information conveyed? This presentation examines the interplay between factual narration and storytelling in journalism, exploring how facts and stories inform one another. Drawing on intermedial theory, this kind of analysis explores truthfulness in communication an interplay of perceived traces of events and communicational coherence (Elleström 2018). The analysis reveals how a set of shared basic features shapes journalistic news narration, but it also matters how these features are assembled, as the specific use of narrative and rhetorical patterns can either support or undermine factuality. For instance, in the fake features of the former German reporter Claas Relotius, narrative coherence and claims of authenticity replace specificity. Furthermore, examples of audiovisual journalism highlight how the increased focus on letting images tell the stories and claims to authenticity transform journalistic narration. Rather than opposing facts and fiction, this approach offers a more nuanced understanding of the narrative challenges of news in a rapidly changing and diverse media landscape So, how does the increased focus on emotionally charged storytelling impact the facts and information conveyed?


Beate Schirrmacher, Associate Professor in Comparative Literature at the Department of Film and Literature, Linnaeus University, Sweden and member of the Linnaeus University Centre for Intermedial and Multimodal Studies. She has studied the intermedial relationships of literature and music. Her current research explores intermedial perspectives on digital convergence, the truth claims of media, and narrative strategies in journalism.
